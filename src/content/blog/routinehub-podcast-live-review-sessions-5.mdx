I started helping out with the RoutineHub Live Review Sessions Podcast sort of by accident a little while back. To make a long story short, I tuned into an episode and discovered they were discussing a Shortcut I created. I ended up joining the conversation and it went from there.

Now I try and help out with every episode I can. It's a lot of fun, and I hope we are able to do them more often soon!

## RoutineHub Live Review Sessions - Episode 5: Focusing On Simplicity

In this episode we cover some simple Shortcuts that are fun to use or perform a simple task quickly. The idea is to show something to people who aren't into automation in general and make them go, "How did you do that?"

## Show Notes

Here are the Shortcuts we reviewed, along with a few notes on how they work. We start with some very simple Shortcuts, and move on to others that are a bit more complicated, yet still conceptually easy to understand.
