## What does it mean when an AI can do math?

The Guarduan [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/23/openai-was-working-on-advanced-model-so-powerful-it-alarmed-staff) how "OpenAI ‘was working on advanced model so powerful it alarmed staff’" yesterday.

A lot of people don't really know what these 'AI' tools even are, let alone how potentially dangerous they could be. In a comment in [this Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1826d8c/comment/kagrdul/) thread, Literature-South breads it down pretty well:
