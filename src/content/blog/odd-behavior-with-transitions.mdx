## What's with the glitchy transitions?

After forking [this](https://github.com/wanoo21/tailwind-astro-starting-blog) awesome theme, and throwing it at Netlify to build I noticed some odd issues with the animation for page transitions.

I posted about it in the [Astro Discord](https://discord.com/channels/830184174198718474/1178031437216235571), and someone mentioned that there isn't a `<ViewTransitions />` tag in the `<head>` of the site, as per [Astro's Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#adding-view-transitions-to-a-page).

That seemed to make sense, so I started looking through the repo code and noticed that there actually isn't a `<head>` tag anywhere to be found. This is incredibly odd because the generated `HTML` definetly contains a `<head>`. ü§®

I know that I am super new to Astro and a complete noon with it comes to web development, but I know that the `<head>` tag is something from _somewhere_...

## Looks like images may be the problem.

Wait... How come this post didn't do that then?

I put that image in the `public` folder instead of the `src/assets`.

My guess is it's something to do with `<ViewTransitions />`, and how Astro imports the image in `src`.

## Reporting the bug

I reported as an issue [here](https://github.com/wanoo21/tailwind-astro-starting-blog/issues/12). I hope he has some time to check it out soon, because I'm kinda stumped on how to prceed.

If I add another `<head>` tag to the `BaseHead` component would it produce two different heads and then mess things up? ü§î

Thanks for reading and I hope this can get resolved soon. I'll definetly let this post stay up as part of my journey re-learning web development. 

Peace! ‚úåÔ∏è
