I used to run a podcast way back in the day called Jailcast. It was a lot of fun and I got the pleasure of chatting with a lot of very talented people in the community.

My favorite episode was the one where I interviewed two jailbreak developers who created <Link href={`https://phoenixpwn.com`} class="text-primary-500 hover:text-sky-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400">The Phoenix Jailbreak</Link>, a *semi-untethered* jailbreak for iOS 9.3.5-9.3.6.

In the episode I interviewed Siguza and tihmstar and asked questions from the community.
