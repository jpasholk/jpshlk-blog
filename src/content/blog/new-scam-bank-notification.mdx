## I Saw This Today On Mastodon

Today on Mastodon, I came across a scarry new scam that cleverly manipulates both phone-based and digital banking safeguards. *Remember, If you think your bank is calling you, always hang up and call back.*

## He Goes On To Mention Just How Sophisticated This Attack Is

Here's how it works: You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from your bank, alerting you to suspected fraudulent activity on your account. 

This might immediately raise your suspicions as a potential scam, but then the caller offers to send you an in-app notification as proof of their legitimacy.

## Some Steps You Can Take To Protect Yourself

- **Verify Independently:** Never trust caller ID or an incoming phone number. If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from your bank, hang up and call back using the official number from your bank's website or your bank card.
- **Do Not Share Personal Information:** During the call, do not share personal information or enter any details into your phone unless you have initiated the call and are certain of the recipient's identity.
- **Be Wary of Pressure:** Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prompt hasty decisions. Take your time and consult with someone you trust if you feel pressured.
- **Use Two-Factor Authentication:** Enable two-factor authentication for your bank and other sensitive accounts, which adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password.
- **Employ Complex Passwords:** Use a tool like <Link href={`https://links.jpshlk.com/bitwarden`} class="text-primary-500 hover:text-sky-600 dark:hover:text-primary-400">Bitwarden's</Link> free version to generate and manage complex passwords, adding another layer of security against unauthorized access.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up to date on the latest scam tactics. Banks often inform customers of common fraud techniques through their websites or emails.
