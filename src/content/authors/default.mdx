![Beautiful morning at Hyatt Lake!](../../assets/hyatt-lake.jpeg)

I like to spend my time with family and friends, and enjoy good times, bad jokes, hot coffee, and cold beer. When I'm not working or hanging out with my lovely girlfriend, I can be found playing pool or disc golf.

I also play the occaisional game on my Nintendo Switch like, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Witcher 3, and Mario RPG.

At work I manage all of the web and marketing operations for our Amazon and Shopify based business. Sometimes I'm creating marketing strategies, others I'm helping develop new products. Then there's the times that I'll have to put out a fire because some online service doesn't want to work (I don't blame them, I really don't either). ðŸ˜œ

I love chatting about e-commerce, marketing, Shopify, and anything tech related really. So hit me up if you'd like!
